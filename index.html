                It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language
                constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.
                Despite its low-level capabilities,
                the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming.
                A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for
                a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its
                source code.[citation needed]</bold></p></td>

                of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
                This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more
                flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
                characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces
                complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling
                the .css file to be cached
                to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</bold></p></td>

            <td><p style="max-width: 300px;"><bold>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented
                 programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as
                  possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application
                   developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code
                    can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[17]
                     Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java 
                     virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
                      The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than
                       either
                       of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and
                        runtime
                       code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[18][19] particularly
                 for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[20]</bold></p></td>
